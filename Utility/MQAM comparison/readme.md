# MQAM Comparison using Grapher V3

The scripts main1.m, main2.m, main3.m, main4.m, and main5.m implement BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM and 256-QAM respectively. <br />

On running init.m, the 5 in sequence, and then plotter.m, you can generate a plot that plots the BER vs SNR plots of the different MQAM schemes. <br />

The simulator is a monte-carlo simulator, so your results may vary slightly from run to run.
