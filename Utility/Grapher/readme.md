The folders here contain all the versions of the plotters. Run them as instructed in the respective documentations for plotting various systems' performances on the same figure. <br/>

Note: Use V3 whenever possible. V1 and V2 are not recommended for use. 

V2 implements V1 but as a single script. <br/>
Shortcomings of V2: <br/>
1. The legend contains incorrect colouring of the plots <br/>
2. The environment is very messy. 

V3 implements the system modularly, and is easy to use. <br/>
Shortcomings of V3: <br/>
1. A GUI could be implemented.
2. The default scripts could be autogenerated.
