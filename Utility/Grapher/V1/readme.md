# Grapher V1

V1 implements basic plotting. <br/>
Shortcomings of V1: <br/>
1. The legend contains incorrect colouring of the plots <br/>
2. The environment is very messy. 

Run main.m after setting up all the desired systems in the same script. 
The configured systems will be plotted on the same figure. <br/>
For plotting multiple figures, duplicate the appropriate section. 

Note: V3 is strictly superior.
