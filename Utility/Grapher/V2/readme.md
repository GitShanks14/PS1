# Grapher V2

V2 implements basic plotting but as a single script. <br/>
Shortcomings of V2: <br/>
1. The legend contains incorrect colouring of the plots <br/>
2. The script does not ask for the user's consent before updating the plot. <br/>

Run main.m to initialize the plot and plot the first system. <br/>
Open plot2.m, set up the desired system. Every time you run plot2.m, the 
configured system will be plotted on the same figure. <br/>
For plotting multiple figures, update plot2.m each time and add a plot. 

Note: V3 is strictly superior.
