# Grapher V3

There are 3 key scripts in this folder : init.m, main1.m, plotter.m. <br/>
the scripts are to be run in the follwing order : <br/>
1. init.m  <br/>
2. main1.m <br/>
.             <br/>
.             <br/>
.             <br/>
2. mainn.m <br/>
3. plotter.m <br/>

First run the init.m script. <br/>
Set SNR to be the x axis elements that you want to generate the plot for. <br/>
Set NScripts to be the number of systems you want to compare. <br/>

Now make NScripts copies of main1.m. name them main2, main3, ... mainn.m. <br/>
Set PlotNumber appropriately in all of the main scripts. <br/>
Configure the ith main file to be the ith system you want to have plotted. <br/>
Run all the mainx.m files. <br/>

Now, select the legend, the colours, the line type in plotter.m, and run the file.  <br/>
The plot will be generated. <br/>










Shortcomings of V3: <br/>
1. A GUI could be implemented.
2. The default scripts could be autogenerated.
