# Grapher V3

There are 3 key scripts in this folder : init.m, main1.m, plotter.m. <br/>
the scripts are to be run in the follwing order : <br/>
1.    init.m
2.1   main1.m
.
.
.
2.n   mainn.m
3.    plotter.m

First run the init.m script. 
Set SNR to be the x axis elements that you want to generate the plot for.
Set NScripts to be the number of systems you want to compare. 

Now make NScripts copies of main1.m. name them main2, main3, ... mainn.m.
Set PlotNumber appropriately in all of the main scripts. 
Configure the ith main file to be the ith system you want to have plotted.
Run all the mainx.m files. 

Now, select the legend, the colours, the line type in plotter.m, and run the file. 
The plot will be generated. 










Shortcomings of V3: <br/>
1. A GUI could be implemented.
2. The default scripts could be autogenerated.
