# Grapher

The folders here contain 2 main scripts each. Run the two as instructed in the respective documentations for plotting various systems' performances on the same figure. <br/>

V1 implements basic plotting. <br/>

Shortcomings of V1: <br/>
1. The legend contains incorrect colouring of the plots <br/>
2. The script does not ask for the user's consent before updating the plot. <br/>
